# Introduction
An introduction should introduce the problem and data you're working on, give some background and relevant detail for the reader, and explain why it is important. 

# Analysis 
Any exploratory analysis of your data, and general summarization of the data (e.g. summary statistics, correlation heatmaps, graphs, information about the data...). Tell the reader about the types of variables you have and some general information about them, Plots and/or Tables are always great. This should also include any cleaning and joining you did. 

If you want a table you can make one with [this website](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) and paste the markdown table here. For example:

| A | B | C | D | E |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| a | b | c | d | e |
| a | b | c | d | e |
| a | b | c | d | e |

(Note that the `width=300` argument controls how wide your image will be.)

# Methods
Explain the structure of your model and your approach to building it. This can also include changes you made to your model in the process of building it. Someone should be able to read your methods section and *generally* be able to tell exactly what architechture you used. However REMEMBER that this should be geared towards an audience who might not understand Tensorflow code. 

# Results
Detailed discussion of how your model performed, and your discussion of how your model performed.

# Reflection
Reflections on what you learned/discovered in the process of doing the assignment. Write about any struggles you had (and hopefully overcame) during the process. Things you would do differently in the future, ways you'll approach similar problems in the future, etc.
