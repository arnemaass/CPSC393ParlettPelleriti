    "1. Choose a book or other text to train your model on (I suggest [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/) to find .txt files but you can find them elsewhere). Make sure your file is a `.txt` file. Clean your data. Build a sequential model (LSTM, GRU, SimpleRNN, or Transformer) that generates new lines based on the training data (NO TRANSFER LEARNING). While your model doesn't need to have perfect accuracy, you must have an appropriate architecture and train it for a reasonable amount of epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Print out or write 10 generated sequences from your model (Similar to Classwork 17 where we generated new Pride and Prejudice lines, but now with words instead of charachters. Feel free to use [this](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12rxdjlEA9JOMQ_jioiEmwjDf6iPhsMmx?usp=sharing) as a reference for how to generate text from a trained model). Assess in detail how good they are, what they're good at, what they struggle to do well. INCLUDE THESE 10 sequences in your report. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Make a new model with ONE substantial adjustment (e.g. use a custom embedding layer if you didn't already, use a pre-trained embedding layer if you didn't already, use a DEEP LSTM/GRU with multiple recurrent layers, use a pre-trained model to do transfer learning and fine-tune it...etc.). While your model doesn't need to have perfect accuracy, you must have an appropriate architecture and train it for a reasonable amount of epochs.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Then create a **technical report** discussing your model building process, the results, and your reflection on it. The report should follow the format in the example including an Introduction, Analysis, Methods, Results, and Reflection section."

    "# Introduction\n",
    "An introduction should introduce the problem you're working on, give some background and relevant detail for the reader, and explain why it is important. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Analysis \n",
    "Any exploratory analysis of your data, and general summarization of the data (e.g. summary statistics, correlation heatmaps, graphs, information about the data...). This can also include any cleaning and joining you did. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Methods\n",
    "Explain the structure of your model and your approach to building it. This can also include changes you made to your model in the process of building it. Someone should be able to read your methods section and *generally* be able to tell exactly what architechture you used. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Results\n",
    "Detailed discussion of how your models performed, and your detailed comparison of your models. Include all the sequences you generated in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reflection\n",
    "Reflections on what you learned/discovered in the process of doing the assignment. Things you would do differently in the future, ways you'll approach similar problems in the future, etc.\n"
