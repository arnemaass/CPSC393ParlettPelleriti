## Course Description
(Prerequisite: CPSC392) Students continue to expand their exposure to machine learning and “big data” techniques from the perspective of both theory and practice. Topics include both supervised and unsupervised learning, including techniques based on Markov models, deep learning, kernel methods, text mining, and others. 

## Course Learning Outcomes
By the end of the semester students will be able to: 
1. Use deep learning techniques for tasks such as image classification 
2. Model sequential/temporal data 
3. Implement deep neural network architectures in Keras 
4. Mine association rules from transaction data. 

## Program Learning Outcomes
The Chapman experience creates outcomes which are consistent with our identity. Similar to the General Education program, each degree program, or major, at Chapman has a unique set of learning outcomes, or student abilities that are not only related to Chapman's institutional mission and goals, but also unique to the student's discipline or field of study. For more information, [Fowler School of Engineering Program Learning Outcomes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OESCtPUolnWFV_qRFuRzNrzxmUtYr5H-dFaYVmPUKY0/edit?usp=sharing).

## General Education Learning Outcomes
Students create sophisticated arguments supported by quantitative evidence and can clearly communicate those arguments in a variety of formats (using words, tables, graphs, mathematical equations, etc., as appropriate).

## Overview
A large focus of course (approximately 50%), will be on artificial neural networks and 
deep learning, including convolutional and recurrent neural networks. Students will 
reinforce theoretical concepts by writing programs to leverage deep learning models 
using the popular libraries Keras (with Tensorflow) and scikit-learn. 
 


## Prerequisites:
CPSC 392.

## Units:
CPSC 393 is a 3 unit course.

## Required Text:
Chollet, F. (2017). Deep learning with python. Manning Publications.

Optional Reading is linked on the Front Page of the Course GitHub.

##  Course materials:
All course materials will be made available via Canvas and/or Github

## Homework, Exams, and Grading (subject to change):
Homework will consist of assignments to reinforce material covered in class, and must be submitted electronically. They will typically be due at 11:59pm (unless otherwise specified). Homework and Projects must be turned in with a README file as either a .txt or a .md file (see Admin Folder on GitHub for a template).

### Late Days
Stuff happens. So, you have 3 "extra days" that you can use, no questions asked, throughout the semester for any homework or project (NOT Quizzes and Tests). You must use 1 whole extra day at a time (i.e. you cannot use 3 hours of an extra day for one assignment, and 21 on another). If an assignment was due Monday at 11:59pm and you use 1 late day, the assignment would then be due Tuesday at 11:59pm.

To qualify for an extra day, you must fill out the **Late Days Google Form*  linked on the front page of our course GitHub under Resources *BEFORE the assignment is due*. Because of these "extra days", late work will automatically be penalized a 0.1% per hour (or part of an hour) late. Because of grading deadlines, extra days CANNOT be used during finals week and may not prevent peer feedback during any assignment.

### Assignments
All programs must be written in Python unless otherwise specified. Grading will be based on correctness, clarity, elegance of solution, and style (comments, naming conventions, etc.) as well as correctness, completeness, and clarity of written answers.

### Assessment Structure
There will be weekly quizzes on the lecture material and classwork, which will count toward the Quizzes grade. Missed quizzes may NOT be made up. However, I will drop your lowest 2 quiz scores at the end of the semester, so use these 2 dropped quizzes to account for sick days or missed classes.

There will also be one in-class midterm exam. In-class exams must be taken on the date specified. *I don't believe taking tests while sick demonstrates your true ability, so in the case of a well-documented, unavoidable conflict or illness, I will do my best to accommodate you. You must notify me prior to missing the exam.*

There will also be a Final Exam and Final Project.


## Course Communication
Information for the course will mainly be disseminated through our Course Slack. YOU MUST join the course slack channel and check for updates. Email through Canvas may also be used. Materials will also be available through the course GitHub (https://github.com/cmparlettpelleriti/CPSC393ParlettPelleriti).

## Collaboration Policy:
You have much to learn from your classmates, and so I encourage you to discuss and study course material together. However, all work you submit for this course must be your own, and must be completed individually unless otherwise specified. More specifically, you may not present source code or programs copied from the Internet, other texts, other students, etc as your own work. Of course, you are free to use whatever reference materials you like, but please cite them in a README turned in with your assignments. I assume you are familiar with Chapman’s policy on academic misconduct is presented below and any incidents of academic misconduct or dishonesty will be dealt with severely in accordance with this policy.

## Expectations and Technology 
I expect that everyone will maintain a classroom conducive to learning. Thus, everyone is 
expected to behave with basic politeness, civility, and respect for others. In particular, talking in class is okay if it’s part of a class discussion or with me. Private communications are not permitted, especially during exams. Neither are reading extraneous materials, using electronic equipment off task, or sleeping. As this is a Computer Science class, technology is allowed to aid in learning and understanding material. However, please do not use a personal device for any purpose unrelated to our class. All devices should be silenced. Cell phones should be put away. 
Suggestions for improvement are welcome at any time. Any concern about the course should be 
brought first to my attention.
